Once your snippets are published on the microsite, you can start sharing them with your audience to boost visibility and engagement.

Snippet AI makes this easy with **built-in social sharing tools**, **OTP-protected links**, and **optional download permissions**.

## Step 1: How to Share Snippets

Every snippet generated by Snippet AI is instantly shareable.

To share a snippet:

1. Go to your **event dashboard** or **microsite view**.
2. Click on any **snippet card** — this opens the snippet in a short clip slider.
3. Tap the **Share icon** (🔗) to reveal sharing options.
4. Choose your preferred platform.

Currently supported major platforms include:

- **LinkedIn**
- **Facebook**
- **X (Twitter)**
- **Instagram**
- **WhatsApp**

When sharing to **WhatsApp**, you can **customize your message** — write a short caption or teaser text that appears along with your snippet link.

 **Example WhatsApp Message:**

> “Check out this powerful moment from India Startup Pavilion at IMC 2025 🚀 — powered by Snippet AI!”

  _Pro Tip:_ Keep your social caption short and intriguing — use 1–2 sentences that create curiosity or FOMO.

## Step 2: OTP-Protected Links

Snippet AI ensures **secure access** for all shared content.

Each shared snippet or microsite link is **OTP-protected**, meaning:

- When a viewer clicks the shared link, they’ll be prompted to **enter their email ID**.
- An **OTP (One-Time Password)** is sent to their email for quick verification.
- After OTP validation, they can instantly view the video or snippet.

This ensures that your event content remains **private, trackable, and safe**, even when shared publicly.

    _Tip:_ Use OTP-protected links when sharing private or invite-only event content — it maintains exclusivity and helps capture verified leads.
  </Tip>

## Step 3: Downloading Snippets

Snippet AI also allows users to **download snippet videos** — if this feature is enabled by the event admin.

Admins can manage download permissions under:

**Settings → Access → Download Permissions**

Options include:

- ✅ Allow all users to download snippets.
- 🔒 Restrict downloads to admin or internal team only.
- ❌ Disable downloads entirely.

Once enabled, users will see a **Download icon (⬇️)** below each snippet.

  _Pro Tip:_ Enable downloads for promotional highlights, press releases, or internal knowledge sharing — and disable it for premium or restricted content.
