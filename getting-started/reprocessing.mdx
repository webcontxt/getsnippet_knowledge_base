Sometimes, the first AI-generated output may not perfectly match your expectations — maybe the summary missed a nuance, or the snippets could be tighter or more impactful.

That’s where Snippet AI’s **Reprocess (Regenerate)** feature comes in.

With a single click, you can ask Snippet AI to take another creative pass at your uploaded content and produce **fresh micro content** — summaries, key takeaways, short clips, and visuals — instantly.

## **What Does “Reprocess” Mean?**

Reprocessing (or regenerating) means Snippet AI will:

- Re-analyze your uploaded video or session.
- Recreate the **Summary**, **Key Takeaways**, and **Snippets (Short Clips)**.
- Refresh **Thumbnails**, **Slider Images**, and **Gallery Visuals** (if applicable).
- Update all micro content automatically in your dashboard and microsite preview.

Essentially, it’s a “redo” button powered by AI — giving you control to refine your results until they feel right.

## **When to Use Reprocess**

You might want to regenerate your content if:

- The generated summary or takeaways feel incomplete or unclear.
- Snippets don’t capture the best highlights or key speaker moments.
- You’ve **added new settings**, like a **watermark**, after the first AI run.
- The **event description or tags** have been updated.
- You simply want a fresh AI perspective to explore better clips or angles.

<Tip>
  _Pro Tip:_ Always ensure your **event details**, **speaker names**, and **session descriptions** are accurate before regenerating — this helps Snippet AI deliver more contextually rich content.

## **How to Reprocess (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Go to Your Dashboard**

   Navigate to the **Session Detail Page** for the specific session you want to regenerate.
2. **Locate the “Regenerate Snippets” Button**

   You’ll find this button next to your existing AI-generated content area.

   🖼️ _Media Suggestion:_
   - Screenshot: Highlight the “Regenerate Snippets” button on the Session page.
   - Short GIF: Cursor clicking on “Regenerate Snippets.”
3. **Click “Regenerate Snippets”**

   Once clicked, Snippet AI will begin processing the content again.

   A small progress loader will appear indicating AI is working.
4. **Wait for Processing**

   Reprocessing usually takes **3–5 minutes** (depending on file size and length).

   You can continue working or browse other sessions while AI regenerates.
5. **Review Fresh Output**

   When done, new **Summaries**, **Key Takeaways**, and **Snippets** will replace the previous ones.

   You can now publish or edit them as needed.

## **Important Notes**

- You can **reprocess a session multiple times**, but note that each regeneration will overwrite previous AI-generated results.
- The **original uploaded video** remains unchanged — only AI-generated micro content is updated.
- If you have already **enabled watermarking** in settings, the new output will now include the watermark automatically.
- Once regeneration is complete, review all snippets before publishing to ensure you’re satisfied with the refreshed results.

  **Pro Tip for Teams:**

  Use regeneration strategically — it’s a great way to A/B test different AI summaries or clip styles before sharing your final microsite publicly.
