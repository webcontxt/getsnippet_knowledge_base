Once you log into Snippet AI, the journey begins by creating your **first project**.

A project represents your **event** — the umbrella under which all your days, tracks, sessions, and speakers live.

Just like a real event, Snippet AI follows a structured flow:\
**Event → Days → Tracks → Sessions → Speakers → Upload → AI Processing**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Event" iconType="solid" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h2">
    To start, click on the **“+ Create Event”** button from your dashboard.

    ![Account Create Event Pn](/images/create_project/account_create_event.png)

    Fill in the event details in the pop-up form:

    - **Event Name** – Give your event a clear, recognizable name.
    - **Location** – Add the venue or city name.
    - **Event Start Date** – The date when the event begins.
    - **Event End Date** – The date when the event concludes.
    - **Event Type** – Choose between:
      - 🟢 **Public Event** – Anyone can access the content by verifying with their email (no admin approval needed).
      - 🔒 **Private Event** – Only users added manually by the admin can access the content.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Event Days" iconType="solid" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h3">
    As soon as you create your event, Snippet AI automatically calculates how many days your event spans and generates those days inside your event dashboard.

    For example:

    - If your event runs from **Nov 1 – Nov 3**, Snippet AI will automatically create **Day 1 (Nov 1)**, **Day 2 (Nov 2)**, and **Day 3 (Nov 3).**

    ![Account Manage Eventdays Pn](/images/create_project/account_manage_eventdays.png)

    You can easily manage these days:

    - 🟢 **Add a Day:** Click “+ Add Day” if your event extends or has an additional activity day.
    - ✏️ **Edit a Day:** Rename or update day details if the schedule changes.
    - ❌ **Delete a Day:** Remove any extra or unused day tabs.

      <Tip>
        Tip\_:\_ Keeping your event organized by days ensures cleaner structure and easier navigation when you have multiple sessions or tracks running simultaneously.
      </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tracks" iconType="solid" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h3">
    Tracks help you organize sessions under broader themes or categories (like “Main Stage,” “Tech Pavilion,” or “Investor Talks”).

    Click inside a **Day**, then select **“Add Track.”**

    - **Track Name** – e.g., “AI & Innovation,” “Startup Stories.”
    - Add as many tracks as your event needs.
    - If your event doesn’t have separate tracks, Snippet AI automatically creates a **default track** for you.
    - Click on **Track Name** to edit the name and hit enter to save

    <Tip>
      _Pro Tip:_ Tracks help your audience easily browse sessions on the final microsite view.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Sessions" iconType="solid" stepNumber={4} titleSize="h3">
    Now that your tracks are set, it’s time to add individual sessions.

    Within a track, click **“Add Session.”**

    Fill in:

    - **Session Name** – e.g., “Beyond ChatGPT: The Future of Generative AI.”
    - **Description** – Briefly describe what the session covers.
    - **Start & End Time** – Helps structure the event schedule.
    - **Tags** – Add topic or industry keywords (e.g., #AI, #Fintech, #Sustainability).

    Once done, click **Save** — your session card will now appear under the respective day and track.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Speakers" iconType="solid" stepNumber={5} titleSize="h3">
    After creating sessions, you can assign speakers to them.

    Click on the **“Add Speaker”** button on the session card.

    Each speaker will be visible on your microsite and linked to their session automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Your Content" iconType="solid" stepNumber={6} titleSize="h3">
    Now you’re ready to upload your session video — the core content Snippet AI will process.

    Click on a **Session Card** → go to the **Session Detail Page** → click **“Upload Video.”**

    Drag & drop your video file or browse to upload.
