Once you log into Snippet AI, the journey begins by creating your **first project**.

A project represents your **event** — the umbrella under which all your days, tracks, sessions, and speakers live.

Just like a real event, Snippet AI follows a structured flow:\
**Event → Days → Tracks → Sessions → Speakers → Upload → AI Processing**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Event" iconType="solid" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h3">
    To start, click on the **“+ Create Event”** button from your dashboard.

    Fill in the event details in the pop-up form:

    - **Event Name** – Give your event a clear, recognizable name.
    - **Location** – Add the venue or city name.
    - **Event Start Date** – The date when the event begins.
    - **Event End Date** – The date when the event concludes.
    - **Event Type** – Choose between:
      - 🟢 **Public Event** – Anyone can access the content by verifying with their email (no admin approval needed).
      - 🔒 **Private Event** – Only users added manually by the admin can access the content.

  <Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">
    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview locally">
    Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    mint dev
    ```

    A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/checks-passed.png"
    alt="Screenshot of a deployment confirmation message that says All checks have passed."
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
