Once you log into Snipin AI, the journey begins by creating your **first project**.

A project represents your **event** — the umbrella under which all your days, tracks, sessions, and speakers live.

Just like a real event, Snipin AI follows a structured flow:\
**Event → Days → Tracks → Sessions → Speakers → Upload → AI Processing**

## 1. Create an Event

To start, click on the **“+ Create Event”** button from your dashboard.

![Account Create Event Pn](/images/create_project/account_create_event.png)

Fill in the event details in the pop-up form:

- **Event Name** – Give your event a clear, recognizable name.
- **Location** – Add the venue or city name.
- **Event Start Date** – The date when the event begins.
- **Event End Date** – The date when the event concludes.
- **Event Type** – Choose between:
  - 🟢 **Public Event** – Anyone can access the content by verifying with their email (no admin approval needed).
  - 🔒 **Private Event** – Only users added manually by the admin can access the content.

## 2. Manage Event Days

As soon as you create your event, Snipin AI automatically calculates how many days your event spans and generates those days inside your event dashboard.

For example:

- If your event runs from **Nov 1 – Nov 3**, Snipin AI will automatically create **Day 1 (Nov 1)**, **Day 2 (Nov 2)**, and **Day 3 (Nov 3).**

![Account Manage Eventdays Pn](/images/create_project/account_manage_eventdays.png)

You can easily manage these days:

- 🟢 **Add a Day:** Click “+ Add Day” if your event extends or has an additional activity day.
- ✏️ **Edit a Day:** Rename or update day details if the schedule changes.
- ❌ **Delete a Day:** Remove any extra or unused day tabs.

  <Tip>
    Tip\_:\_ Keeping your event organized by days ensures cleaner structure and easier navigation when you have multiple sessions or tracks running simultaneously.
  </Tip>

## 3. Add Tracks

Tracks help you organize sessions under broader themes or categories (like “Main Stage,” “Tech Pavilion,” or “Investor Talks”).

Click inside a **Day**, then select **“Add Track.”**

- **Track Name** – e.g., “AI & Innovation,” “Startup Stories.”
- Add as many tracks as your event needs.
- If your event doesn’t have separate tracks, Snipin AI automatically creates a **default track** for you.
- Click on **Track Name** to edit the name and hit enter to save

<Tip>
  _Pro Tip:_ Tracks help your audience easily browse sessions on the final microsite view.
</Tip>

## 4. Add Sessions

Now that your tracks are set, it’s time to add individual sessions.

Within a track, click **“Add Session.”**

Fill in:

- **Session Name** – e.g., “Beyond ChatGPT: The Future of Generative AI.”
- **Description** – Briefly describe what the session covers.
- **Start & End Time** – Helps structure the event schedule.
- **Tags** – Add topic or industry keywords (e.g., #AI, #Fintech, #Sustainability).

Once done, click **Save** — your session card will now appear under the respective day and track.

## 5: Map Speakers

After creating sessions, you can assign speakers to them.

Click on the **“Add Speaker”** button on the session card.

![Account Addspeakerbutton Pn](/images/create_project/account_addspeakerbutton.png)

Click on search speakers and then click on “+Add Speraker”

Fill in:

- **Speaker Name**
- **Designation / Company**
- **Short Bio (optional)**
- **Profile Picture (optional)**

![Account Assignspeakerpopup Pn](/images/create_project/account_assignspeakerpopup.png)

![Account Addspeakerform Pn](/images/create_project/account_addspeakerform.png)

![Account Speakercreated Pn](/images/create_project/account_speakercreated.png)

Each speaker will be visible on your microsite and linked to their session automatically.

## 6: Upload Your Content

Now you’re ready to upload your session video — the core content Snipin AI will process.
