Your event content doesn’t just end with publishing — it’s about understanding how your audience interacts with it.

Snippet AI’s **Analytics Dashboard** gives you a complete overview of snippet engagement and event-level performance, helping you make data-driven decisions for future events.

## Step 1: View Snippet Performance Data

Each snippet you publish is tracked for audience engagement in real time.

Under the **Snippets Tab**, you’ll find clear metrics that show how your content is performing.

For every snippet, you can view:

- 👍 **Likes** – Number of positive reactions your snippet received.
- 👎 **Dislikes** – How many users reacted negatively.
- 🔗 **Shares** – How often the snippet was shared to social media or copied via link.
- ⬇️ **Downloads** – Total number of snippet downloads (if enabled by admin).

**Why It Matters:**

These insights help you identify your **most engaging clips** — the ones your audience loves, shares, and responds to the most.
