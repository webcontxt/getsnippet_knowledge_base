Once Snippet AI finishes processing your session videos, the real magic begins — your event’s **microsite** is automatically generated.

This is your ready-to-share digital hub where your audience can explore key moments, short clips, takeaways, and visuals — all powered by Snippet AI.

## Step 1: Viewing Auto-Generated Snippets

After processing is complete, go to your event dashboard and click on the event and you will see “ Preview Frontend” Link at top right to access your microsite.

You’ll see several automatically generated content sections:

- **Summary:** A concise AI-written overview of your session.
- **Snippets:** Short, shareable video moments (usually 30–60 seconds).
- **Key Takeaways:** Core insights and highlights extracted from your session.
- **Visuals:** Smartly captured stills and thumbnails from the video for use in galleries or sliders.

  <Tip>
    _Tip:_ Each snippet is auto-tagged and grouped under its respective track or session to keep your microsite clean and structured automatically.
  </Tip>

## Step 2: Editing Titles and Descriptions

Every snippet and takeaway comes with automatically generated text, but you can personalize it to match your tone or branding.

To edit:

1. Click the **Edit icon** (✏️) beside the snippet title or description.
2. Make your changes.
3. Click **Save** — the microsite updates instantly.

You can edit:

- Snippet titles and captions
- Session descriptions
- Key takeaway bullet points

<Tip>
  _Pro Tip:_ Use short, action-driven titles like “Top Insights from the Keynote” or “Why AI Matters for Events” — they perform better on social and microsites.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Publishing or Unpublishing Micro Content

Not every generated snippet needs to go live — you have full control.

On your session or event page, you’ll find a **Publish Toggle** for each snippet or takeaway:

- 🟢 **Publish ON:** Visible on your live microsite.
- 🔴 **Publish OFF:** Hidden from public view (but still available in your dashboard).

To publish/unpublish:

1. Toggle the switch beside the snippet.
2. Changes reflect instantly on your microsite preview.

  _Tip:_ Use this to curate your microsite and show only the most engaging or relevant content.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Organizing Snippets into Sections or Tracks

Snippet AI automatically organizes all your content by:

- **Event → Day → Track → Session**

You don’t need to manually arrange anything — each session’s snippets and visuals appear under the right track and day automatically.

<Tip>
  _Pro Tip:_ This structure makes your event content feel cohesive and easy to navigate — especially for multi-track, multi-day events.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Managing Public vs Private Access

Control who can view your microsite content.

Go to **Settings → Access Control** in your event dashboard.

You’ll see two options:

- 🌐 **Public Access:** Anyone can view the microsite by entering their email and verifying via OTP.
- 🔒 **Private Access:** Only users whose emails are pre-approved by the admin can access the content.

<Tip>
  _Tip:_ For internal events or paid content, choose **Private Mode**. For marketing or lead generation, go **Public** to drive reach and visibility.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Preview Your Microsite

Once you’ve published your snippets and visuals, click **“Preview Microsite”** from your event dashboard.

This opens a live preview where you can:

- See how snippets appear on your event page.
- Check visuals, key takeaways, and speaker cards.
- Validate layout before sharing it publicly.

  _Pro Tip:_ Always review your microsite on both desktop and mobile — Snippet AI’s microsites are fully responsive and optimized for both.
</Tip>

## Step 7: Share Your Microsite

When your microsite is ready, you can share it directly with your audience.

Options include:

- Copying your unique **microsite link**.
- Embedding the microsite in your **event website or platform**.
- Sharing individual snippets on **LinkedIn, X (Twitter), or Instagram**.
