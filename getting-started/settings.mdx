## **1. Access**

The **Settings → Access** panel allows event admins to manage how users log in, who can access content, and how sharing, downloading, and branding work on your microsite.

This is your control center for managing event visibility, security, and presentation.

### **Section 01: Attendee Login Mechanism**

Determine how attendees will access your event microsite.

You can set the login policy depending on whether the event is open to all or restricted to a specific audience.

### **1. Open Login**

- Anyone with the microsite link can sign up and log in.
- The user simply enters their **email ID**, receives an **OTP**, and gets access immediately.
- Perfect for **public or promotional events** where you want maximum visibility and reach.

### **2. Closed Login**

- Only **pre-approved attendees** can log in.
- Admins must upload or maintain a list of allowed users (email IDs) in the backend.
- Best suited for **private, corporate, or invite-only events** to maintain content exclusivity.

  _Tip:_ Use _Closed Login_ for client-specific or confidential content to ensure only authorized attendees can view snippets.
</Tip>

### **Section 02: Share and Download Permissions**

Define what attendees can do with your content.

Snippet AI gives full control over **sharing**, **downloading**, and **watermarking** for brand and IP protection.

### **Allow Sharing**

- Toggle **ON/OFF** to control whether attendees can share snippets externally.
- When enabled, the **Share** button appears on each snippet card.

### **Allow Downloading**

### **Allow Watermark**

- Toggle **ON/OFF** to brand your snippets with a watermark image.
- When enabled, Snippet AI will ask you to upload your **watermark file (PNG/JPG)** — typically your event or brand logo.
- This watermark will automatically appear in the background of every snippet generated **after activation**.

⚠️ **Important:**

- The watermark must be enabled **before** snippet generation.
- If you activate watermarking after snippets are generated, you must **regenerate snippets** for the watermark to appear.

<Tip>
  _Pro Tip:_ Always upload your watermark before AI generation to save time on reprocessing.
</Tip>

### **Share Content (Predefined Text Field)**

- When **Allow Sharing** is enabled, this field activates.
- You can enter a short predefined message that appears automatically when users share snippets via **WhatsApp** or other platforms.

  Example:

  > “Check out this amazing moment from [Your Event Name] — powered by Snippet AI! ”

<Tip>
  _Pro Tip:_ Add hashtags or your event handle here to boost brand reach on social platforms.
</Tip>

### **Section 03: Attendees**

![Setting Branding Pn](/images/setting/setting_branding.png)

### **Branding Options:**

- **Background Color:**

  Choose a background color (e.g., `#4658A7`) that matches your event theme.

  This color appears on the **login page** and the **header section** of your microsite.
- **Logo:**

  Upload your event or organization logo.

  If uploaded, it will display on the **login screen** and **header** of the microsite.

  If not uploaded, the **event name** will appear instead.

<Tip>
  _Pro Tip:_ Use a high-contrast background color and transparent PNG logo for a polished look.
</Tip>

### **Section 05: Domain**

Each microsite can be mapped to a **custom domain** for a seamless branded experience.

Example:

Instead of

> yourbrand.getsnippet.ai
>
> you can use
>
> `events.yourbrand.com`

### To Configure:

1. Enter your **custom domain URL** in the input field.
2. Click **Save**.
3. Update your DNS settings as instructed (if required).
